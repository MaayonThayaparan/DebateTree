Lovable PRP
Product Name (working title)

DebateTree (placeholder — can be renamed later)

One-sentence idea

A social, mobile-first discussion platform that structures debates into agree, disagree, and neutral nodes, making conversations clearer, more thoughtful, and measurable.

Problem it solves

Traditional discussion platforms (Reddit, Twitter, comment sections) flatten debate, causing repetition, noise, and low-quality arguments. This product introduces a structured node-based debate system that makes agreement, disagreement, and sentiment explicit, while remaining social and familiar.

Target Audience

General public (casual browsing, late-night scrolling)

Students and academics (structured debates, argument clarity)

Knowledge workers and thinkers

Anyone who enjoys discussion or debate

The app is universal, not niche — designed to scale from casual topics to high-level discourse.

Platform

Responsive web app

Mobile-first UX (optimized for vertical scrolling and touch)
